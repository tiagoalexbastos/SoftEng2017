3- DEVELOPMENT
==============

Arquitecture
-------------

- Frontend
   - Done in JSF with PrimeFaces.
   - Contains 4 dashboards with informations related to 4 sensors.
   - It's possible to verify the history of valores that have been saved, by requesting them to the DB.

- DB
   - The database is done in JPA and receives all the values read by the sensors.
   - This values are saved and can be sent to the Dashboard by websockets.

- DataCollector
   - It represents the data received from the different sensors through the RabbitMQ.

Data Model
-----------

- External Events
   - Sensors send the data to a RabbitMQ broker


- External Events for Datacollector
   - Data arrives from RabbitMQ
   - Forward it with specific messages to dashboard


- External Events for Dashboard
   - Data arrives from datacollector
   - Process it
   - Send it to dashboard
   - Check for values above threshold

Deployment
-----------

The deployment is processed by Jenkins. It is autonomous and it develops all the containers and puts them online.
Our project contains the following containers:

- ELK
   - ElasticSearch
   - Logstash
   - Kibana    

- POSTGRES DB
- RabbitMQ
- JSF Dashboard
- Tomcat for the gateway
- JPA
- Processing Unit python
