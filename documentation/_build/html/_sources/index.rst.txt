Software Engeneering: "The Domotics scenario"
=============================================

"Domotics (from the latin word "domus", house), it's the encounter of information technology, electrotechnics and electronics that makes a home become "smart".

It's the tool that allows to control systems, devices and automations with the aim of increase the living and comfort quality of the domestic space, but not only.

The building starts to develop its "own intelligence", characterised not by the amount of high technology it contains, but by the way in which the technologies integration is projected and by how these technologies are able to satisfy the individuals' needs, which are always in evolution."
